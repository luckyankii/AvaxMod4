# ChooseFriendsWisely (CFW) ERC-20 Token

## Overview

ChooseFriendsWisely (CFW) is an ERC-20 token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This token is designed with a unique functionality where users can redeem items by burning a specified amount of CFW tokens.

## Features

- **ERC-20 Compliance:** The CFW token follows the ERC-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with various decentralized applications (DApps) and exchanges.
  
- **Redeemable Items:** Users can redeem items by burning a predefined amount of CFW tokens. This functionality is implemented to encourage thoughtful use of the token.

- **Minting:** The contract owner has the ability to mint new CFW tokens, providing a mechanism for token distribution.

## Contract Details

- **Token Name:** ChooseFriendsWisely
- **Token Symbol:** CFW
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** Initially set to 1000 CFW tokens

## Smart Contract Structure

The smart contract is structured as follows:

- **`ChooseFriendsWisely.sol`:** The main contract file containing the implementation of the CFW ERC-20 token, which inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and Ownable contracts.

## Functions

- **`mint(address acnt, uint amnt) public onlyOwner`:** Allows the contract owner to mint additional CFW tokens and assign them to a specified address.

- **`redeemItem() public`:** Users can redeem items by burning a specified amount of CFW tokens. The function ensures that the user's balance is sufficient and that the items haven't been redeemed before.

- **`burn(uint amnt) public`:** Allows users to burn a specified amount of CFW tokens, reducing their balance.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens.
   - Use a development environment with Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or compatible.

2. **Deploying the Contract:**
   - Deploy the `ChooseFriendsWisely` contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

3. **Interacting with the Contract:**
   - Mint CFW tokens using the `mint` function.
   - Redeem items by calling the `redeemItem` function.
   - Burn CFW tokens using the `burn` function.
